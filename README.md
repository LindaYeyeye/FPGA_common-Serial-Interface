# FPGA_common-Serial-Interface
I2C/UART/SPI driven and test code based on verilog.

## I2C
To drive ov5640 sensor with SCCB, the code only contains the basic FSM sturcture, you can add 'paramater' to use in different condition

## SPI
To drive ADC128s106 and LTC2442, the code has been tested with hardware connected.

## UART
To transmit code from FPGA to PC, tested successfully before.
